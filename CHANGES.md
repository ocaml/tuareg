unreleased
----------

* Add support for [opam-switch-mode](https://github.com/ProofGeneral/opam-switch-mode): enable the mode with <kbd>M-x opam-switch-mode</kbd> or add an automatic hook `(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook #'opam-switch-mode)`.

3.0.1 2022-09-29
----------------

Generate `tuareg.install`.

3.0 2022-09-27
--------------

Backward incompatible changes are marked with “⚠”.

* New option `tuareg-mode-line-other-file`.
* New mode `tuareg-menhir-mode`.
  Note that <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> launches the compilation.
* ⚠ `tuareg-eval-phrase` (<kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>) now
  evaluate the smallest set of phrases containing the region if the
  latter is active.
* ⚠ `tuareg-eval-phrase` now skips `;;` even on a separate line when moving
  forward. This permits quick evaluation of multiple phrases in succession.
* ⚠ `tuareg-eval-region` (<kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>): only send the content of
  the region to the REPL.
* Be more subtle in phrase detection.
* Bogus mismatched parentheses at the end of comment fixed.
* ⚠ `show-paren-mode`: also highlight comment delimiters.  You can
  turn that off by setting `tuareg-comment-show-paren` to `nil`.
* Syntax highlighting improvements: much faster; much better highlighting
  of function, class, and method arguments (including setting the
  `font-lock-multiline` property); `[]` and `::` have the constructor
  face; first class module, `type nonrec`, `raise_notrace`, `with
  type` are handled.  Finer highlighting of infix operators.  Support
  for [binding operators][].  Moreover, font-lock now has 3 possible
  levels of fontification (see the README).
* The switch .ml ↔ .mli now uses the Emacs built-in `find-file` and
  was extended to `.eliom` ↔ `.eliomi` and `.mly` ↔ `.mli`.  It also
  works for pre-processed files named `.pp.ml` and `.pp.mli`.
* When switching from an `.ml` to a non-existing `.mli` file using
  <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>, one is offered to fill the `.mli` buffer with the
  generated interface.
* Set `beginning-of-defun-function` and `end-of-defun-function` which
  allows to go to the beginning of the current function (resp. end)
  with <kbd>C-M-home</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> or <kbd>ESC
  C-home</kbd> (resp. <kbd>C-M-end</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-e</kbd>, or
  <kbd>ESC C-end</kbd>).
* ⚠ `beginning-of-defun` (<kbd>C-M-a</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-home</kbd>) is
  now repeatable. Previously it would not move the cursor if invoked
  at the beginning of a defun. Now it goes to the start of the
  previous defun, which is the standard in Emacs and generally more
  useful.
* ⚠ Movement by defun now considers `and` clauses of a `type` or
  declarative `let` to be defuns in their own right, since that's
  closer to how programmers think. This generally makes defun-based
  operations more useful.
* ⚠ `tuareg-comment-dwim` is now bound to <kbd>C-c C-;</kbd> (fixes #149).
* Fix the highlighting of errors locations in interactive mode.
* ocamldebug: Handle correctly the new code pointer format (issue #205).
* Rework electric functions (fixes issues #150 and #162).
* Update the compilation regexp to detect warnings and errors for the
  OCaml ≥ 4.08 (fixes #202).
* Autoload compilation error regexp so it is correct even if Tuareg
  was not loaded.
* Messages from recent OCaml compiler versions are now parsed
  correctly for severity and source location. This includes precise
  parsing of the location start and end columns. Exception backtraces
  are now also recognised.
* Ancillary locations are now treated as Info-level messages, not
  errors in their own right. This way they no longer contribute to
  Emacs's compilation-mode error count, but they will be ignored by
  `next-error` and `previous-error`. Set `compilation-skip-threshold`
  to `0` if you want `next-error` to step into these locations.
* Evaluation of phrases: evaluate the above phrase if the point is in
  or after comments immediately following the let-binding (without
  separating blank lines).
* Better indentation of empty lines (fixes #179).
* Use a pty to communicate with the `ocaml` process (fixes #83).
* `tuareg-opam`: syntax highlighting updates.
* ⚠ Remove `tuareg-light`, you should now use `tuareg`.
* `class type` is now parsed correctly (#239).
* Improved indentation of class definition with non-hanging `object` (#239).
  The new behaviour agrees with ocp-indent and seems to be the more modern
  usage. `initialize` clauses are also indented correctly.
* Better default colour for extension nodes on dark background.
  `tuareg-font-lock-extension-node-face` was nigh-unreadable against
  a dark background. The face now uses the default background colour.
* Ocamldoc `(** ... *)` comments are now fontified by their structure.
  This makes markup constructs stand out in order to improve legibility
  and reduces the risk of mistakes. The body text is set in
  `font-lock-doc-face` as before; mark-up constructs use
  `tuareg-font-lock-doc-markup-face`, which defaults to
  `font-lock-doc-markup-face` (new in Emacs 28) if available.

Note that the mode `tuareg-dune` which was in the development version
of this package is now part of [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).

2.1.0 2017-11-10
----------------

* Let <kbd>M-q</kbd> reformat strings (and use only SMIE).
* Do not indent an expression after `;;` (issue #106).
* New face `tuareg-font-double-colon-face` to highlight `;;`.
* For `type … and …`, left-align `and` with `type`.
* Fix indentation of some GADT type definitions.
* Use `prettify-symbols-mode` to turn `+.` into `∔`,… and add a menu
  entry to toggle it.
* Properly indent `type 'a foo = 'a bla = …` (issue #98).
* Properly indent (issue #7):

        module … with module X = Z
                  and type t := C.t

* Support `let exception E in expr` (issue #102).
* Improved highlighting of `val` and `module` in first class module
  expressions.
* Warn if a file inside a `_build` is edited and propose to switch.
* Add a custom face `tuareg-font-lock-label-face` for labels.
* Add option `tuareg-match-patterns-aligned` to allow to choose
  between the two styles:

        function          v.s.        function
        | A                           | A
          | B -> ...                  | B -> ...
        | C -> ...                    | C -> ... "

* Highlight attributes and extension nodes.
* Disable by default and improve the compilation advice—see the new
  variable `tuareg-opam-insinuate` (issue #97).
* New keybinding <kbd>C-cC-w</kbd> and function `tuareg-opam-update-env`
  to update the environment to an opam switch (offering completion).
* Improved highlighting of quoted strings `{|…|}` (issue #89).
* Move after `;;` when evaluating a phrase in the toploop (issue #96).

* ocamldebug:
  - Add support for `completion-at-point`.
  - Highlight the right location even in presence of non-ascii chars
	(issue #80).
  - Make possible to pass argument to ocamldebug (say, paths with `-I`).
  - Make possible to pass argument to the program being debugged (issue #66).
  - Warn if SMIE is disabled.

* New modes `tuareg-jbuild` and `tuareg-opam` with syntax
  highlighting, indentation, and skeletons.

2.0.10

  `tuareg-font-lock-module-face', `tuareg-font-lock-constructor-face',
  and `tuareg-font-lock-line-number-face'.
* Non-closed comment does not cause M-q to hang.
* New variables `caml-types-build-dirs' and `caml-types-annot-dir' for
  a more versatile specification of .annot files.  (Submitted back to
  caml-mode.)
* Fix toplevel highlighting of output and errors.
