1.12    Speed-up and fixes.

 to     Support for symbol fontifying, adaptation of Font-Lock interface,
1.27    Rewritting of a new Sym-Lock extension for Font-Lock (more powerful,
        polyvalent, and fitting dynamic customization). Suggestion and first
        adaptation by Chrstian Boos <boos@arthur.u-strasbg.fr>.
	Improved phrase detection. `C-M-h' and `C-c C-e' now detect
	both beginning and end of phrases ; `;;' is used, if present.
	Improved `tuareg-interactive' mode. Support for Font-Lock
	on toplevel inputs. Patchs for many phrase detection bugs.

	indentation of `;' sequences accelerated.

1.30  - April 14 1998 -
	Major improvement of syntax parsing code (including proper handling
	of multi-line strings and speed-up). Strong speed-up of parenthesis
	parsing. A few indentation and phrase-related commands bugs corrected.
1.31  - June 8 1998 -
	Lot of bugs corrected, new customization (more flexible and usable,
        with some examples). Minor Sym-Lock changes, indentation changes in
        some cases, simplified installation guidelines.
1.32  - June 26 1998 -
        Only with XEmacs: Correct string/comment hiliting.
        A few bugs removed, especially in literal/comment detection.

	New support for OCaml 2.00 syntax (let module X=..., and {r with ...}).
	Indentation bug corrected for arrays, records and objects.
1.34  - December 15 1998 -
	Bugs corrected in OCaml 2.00 syntax, added new indentation options
	for parentheses and = symbols.
1.35  - January 13 1999 -
	Major improvement of interactive mode, thanks to contribution
	of Michel Quercia. Bug removal in phrase detection and comment
	indentation (paragraph and lines).
1.36  - January 22 1999 -
	Navigation support for OCaml manual, library, and buffer-dependent
	definitions (adapted from original code by Michel Quercia). New
	commands, and next-error in toplevel by Claude Marché.
1.37  - May 18 2000 -
	Many improvements and extended support for OCaml 3.00 (like label
	hiliting). Improved FSF Emacs compatibility thanks to Rémi Vanicat.
	Corrected bugs in string/comment recognition (the last ones?).
1.38  - September 19 2000 -
	Standard Customization interface, removal of most non-standard
	font-lock faces, string/comment hiliting for FSF Emacs
	eventually matches XEmacs performances; plus a lot of minor fixes.

1.40  - June 26 2002 -
	Major update: FSF Emacs 21 compatibility (lazy Font-Lock support),
        new indentation features (e.g., smart comment justification styles),
        robust hiliting for declarations, many bugs corrected.
1.41  - December 8 2003 -
	Indentation and hiliting features, many intermediate versions
        with minor bug fixes, support for caml-types.
1.42  - November 5 2004 -
	MetaOCaml support, many bug fixes, major rewrite of hiliting code,
        many improvements and bug fixes to the indentation code,
        refactoring of some deprecated code (by Stefan Monnier).
1.43  - November 21 2004 -
	Improved MetaOCaml support, phrase mark/evaluation fixes,
	many improvements to module indentation and marking, removed
	aggresive inlining after `=' and fixed related bugs.
1.44  - December 29 2004 -
	Major fontification improvements, largely by Stefan Monnier.
	Many bug fixes related with the improvements in 1.42 and 1.43.
1.45  - March 28 2005 -

        Stefan Monnier. Initiation of a migration of the syntax cache to
        PPSS for comments and string.
1.46  - May 21 2006 -
	Integration of more language variants. A future version will
	modularize this support, to improve flexibility and minimize
	interference risks. Plus various bug fixes and new features.
